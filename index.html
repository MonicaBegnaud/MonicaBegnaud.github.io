<body>

  <h1>Monica Begnaud</h1>
  <h2>I started as a Computer Science major, but am now looking to complete my degree in Computing Applications. </h2>

  <p> 
    My goal for this course is to come away with a applicable understanding of HTML and web development that I can use outside of 
    just coursework. The last time I did any sort of website design was in highschool using Adobe Dreamweaver.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    I haven't really figured out how I'm going to apply my degree after graduation. I am in a comfrtable position at my current job and a 
  degree doesn't necessarily help me advance but could potentially help me move somewhat laterally with new opportunites to advance.
